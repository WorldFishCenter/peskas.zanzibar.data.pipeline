# Preprocess Track Data into Spatial Grid Summary

This function processes GPS track data into a spatial grid summary,
calculating time spent and other metrics for each grid cell. The grid
size can be specified to analyze spatial patterns at different scales.

## Usage

``` r
preprocess_track_data(data, grid_size = 500)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing GPS track data with columns:

  - Trip: Unique trip identifier

  - Time: Timestamp of the GPS point

  - Lat: Latitude

  - Lng: Longitude

  - Speed (M/S): Speed in meters per second

  - Range (Meters): Range in meters

  - Heading: Heading in degrees

- grid_size:

  Numeric. Size of grid cells in meters. Must be one of:

  - 100: ~100m grid cells

  - 250: ~250m grid cells

  - 500: ~500m grid cells (default)

  - 1000: ~1km grid cells

## Value

A tibble with the following columns:

- Trip: Trip identifier

- lat_grid: Latitude of grid cell center

- lng_grid: Longitude of grid cell center

- time_spent_mins: Total time spent in grid cell in minutes

- mean_speed: Average speed in grid cell (M/S)

- mean_range: Average range in grid cell (Meters)

- first_seen: First timestamp in grid cell

- last_seen: Last timestamp in grid cell

- n_points: Number of GPS points in grid cell

## Details

The function creates a grid by rounding coordinates based on the
specified grid size. Grid sizes are approximate due to the conversion
from meters to degrees, with calculations based on 1 degree ≈ 111km at
the equator. Time spent is calculated using the time differences between
consecutive points.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Process tracks with 500m grid (default)
result_500m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data)

# Use 100m grid for finer resolution
result_100m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 100)

# Use 1km grid for broader patterns
result_1km <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 1000)
} # }
```
