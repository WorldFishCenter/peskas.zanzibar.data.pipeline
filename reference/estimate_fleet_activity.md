# Estimate Fleet-Wide Activity from Sample Data

Estimates total fleet activity by scaling sample-based trip statistics
using boat registry data. Calculates sampling rates and confidence
levels for the estimates.

## Usage

``` r
estimate_fleet_activity(monthly_stats, boat_registry)
```

## Arguments

- monthly_stats:

  Data frame from
  [`calculate_monthly_trip_stats()`](https://worldfishcenter.github.io/peskas.zanzibar.data.pipeline/reference/calculate_monthly_trip_stats.md)
  containing:

  - district: District name

  - date_month: Month as date

  - sample_total_trips: Total trips from tracked boats

  - sample_boats_tracked: Number of tracked boats

  - avg_trip_duration_hrs: Average trip duration

  - avg_trips_per_boat_per_month: Average trips per boat

- boat_registry:

  Data frame with columns:

  - district: District name (must match monthly_stats)

  - total_boats: Total number of boats registered in district

## Value

A data frame combining monthly statistics with fleet estimates:

- district: District name

- date_month: Month as date

- sample_total_trips: Total trips from tracked boats

- sample_boats_tracked: Number of tracked boats

- avg_trip_duration_hrs: Average trip duration

- avg_trips_per_boat_per_month: Average trips per boat

- estimated_total_trips: Estimated trips for entire fleet

- sampling_rate: Proportion of fleet tracked (0-1)

- estimate_confidence: Confidence level ("High", "Medium", "Low")

## Details

This function combines monthly trip statistics from GPS-tracked boats
with boat registry data to estimate fleet-wide fishing activity. It
calculates:

- Estimated total trips if all boats were tracked

- Sampling rate (tracked boats / total boats)

- Confidence levels based on sampling coverage

Confidence levels are assigned as:

- High: ≥30% of fleet tracked

- Medium: 10-29% of fleet tracked

- Low: \<10% of fleet tracked

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# First calculate monthly stats
monthly_stats <- calculate_monthly_trip_stats(trips_data)

# Then estimate fleet activity
fleet_estimates <- estimate_fleet_activity(monthly_stats, boat_registry)

# Check confidence levels
fleet_estimates |>
  dplyr::count(estimate_confidence)
} # }
```
