\description{
Validates Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) survey data by performing quality checks and calculating catch metrics.
The function follows these main steps:
\enumerate{
\item Preprocesses survey data
\item Validates catches using predefined thresholds for weights, counts and prices
\item Calculates revenue and CPUE metrics
\item Uploads validated data to cloud storage
}
}
\details{
The validation includes:
\itemize{
\item Basic data quality checks (e.g., negative catches, missing values)
\item Gear-specific validations (e.g., number of fishers per gear type)
\item Weight thresholds by catch type (individual vs bucket measures)
\item Market price validations (valid price ranges per kg)
}
