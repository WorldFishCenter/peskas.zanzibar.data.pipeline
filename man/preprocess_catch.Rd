\title{Preprocess Catch Data for Both Survey Versions}
\usage{
preprocess_catch(data = NULL, version = NULL)

preprocess_catch(data = NULL, version = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing raw survey data with species groups}

\item{version}{Character string specifying version ("v1" or "v2"). If NULL,
version will be auto-detected based on column patterns.}
}
\value{
A data frame with processed catch data including:
submission_id, n_catch, count_method, catch_taxon, n_buckets, weight_bucket,
individuals, length

\description{
Processes catch data from WorldFish surveys, handling both version 1 and version 2
survey structures. Automatically detects survey version and applies appropriate
species field normalization and length group processing.

\details{
The function uses \code{reshape_catch_data_v2()} internally which automatically handles:
\itemize{
\item Version 1: Single species field, nested length groups
\item Version 2: Multiple species fields (species_TL, species_RF, etc.),
separate length group structure for fish >100cm
}
