\title{Generate Complete Fleet Activity Analysis Pipeline}
\usage{
generate_fleet_analysis(log_threshold = logger::DEBUG)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_threshold}{Logging threshold level (default: logger::DEBUG).
Controls the verbosity of logging output during pipeline execution.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function's primary purpose is to:
\itemize{
\item Generate and save aggregated analysis results to RDS file
\item Upload results to cloud storage
\item Log progress and completion status
}
}
\description{
Executes the complete fleet activity analysis pipeline from data retrieval through
final aggregation and cloud storage upload. This function orchestrates all steps
including metadata retrieval, trip processing, fleet estimation, and results storage.
}
\details{
This function executes the complete analysis pipeline:
\enumerate{
\item Reads configuration parameters and retrieves metadata
\item Prepares boat registry from metadata
\item Processes trip data from PDS API using device IMEIs
\item Downloads monthly summaries from cloud storage
\item Calculates monthly trip statistics from GPS data
\item Estimates fleet-wide activity using boat registry
\item Calculates district totals using catch/revenue data
\item Generates annual summary statistics by district
\item Saves aggregated results to RDS file and uploads to cloud storage
}

The function creates a comprehensive analysis that scales GPS-tracked boat data
to estimate total fleet activity, catch, and revenue by district and time period.
}
\section{Output Files}{

The function creates an RDS file containing a list with three components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{fleet_estimates}: Monthly fleet activity estimates by district
\item \strong{district_totals}: Monthly district-level catch and revenue totals
\item \strong{annual_summary}: Annual summary statistics by district including:
\itemize{
\item months_with_data: Number of months with data
\item avg_sampling_rate: Average sampling rate across months
\item total_estimated_catch_kg: Total estimated annual catch
\item total_estimated_revenue: Total estimated annual revenue
\item avg_monthly_catch_kg: Average monthly catch
\item avg_monthly_revenue: Average monthly revenue
}
}
}

\dontrun{
# Run complete fleet analysis pipeline
