\title{Validate Wild Fishing Survey Data}
\usage{
validate_wf_surveys(log_threshold = logger::DEBUG)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_threshold}{The logging level threshold for the logger package (e.g., DEBUG, INFO)}
}
\value{
The function processes and uploads two datasets to cloud storage:
\enumerate{
\item Validation flags for each submission
\item Validated survey data with invalid submissions removed
}
}
\description{
Validates survey data from wild fishing activities by applying quality control checks
and flagging potential data issues. The function filters out submissions that don't
meet validation criteria and processes catch data.
}
\details{
The function applies the following validation checks:
\enumerate{
\item Bucket weight validation (max 50 kg per bucket)
\item Number of buckets validation (max 300 buckets)
\item Number of individuals validation (max 100 individuals)
\item Form completeness check for catch details
\item Catch information completeness check
}

Alert codes:
\itemize{
\item 5: Bucket weight exceeds maximum
\item 6: Number of buckets exceeds maximum
\item 7: Number of individuals exceeds maximum
\item 8: Incomplete catch form
\item 9: Incomplete catch information
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Requires configuration parameters to be set up in config file
\item Automatically downloads preprocessed survey data from cloud storage
\item Removes submissions that fail validation checks
\item Sets catch_kg to 0 when catch_outcome is 0
}
}
\section{Data Processing Steps}{

\enumerate{
\item Downloads preprocessed survey data
\item Applies validation checks and generates alert flags
\item Filters out submissions with validation alerts
\item Processes catch data and adjusts catch weights
\item Uploads validation flags and validated data to cloud storage
}
}
