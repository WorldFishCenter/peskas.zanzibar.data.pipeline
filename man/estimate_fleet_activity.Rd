\title{Estimate Fleet-Wide Activity from Sample Data}
\usage{
estimate_fleet_activity(monthly_stats, boat_registry)
}
\arguments{
\item{monthly_stats}{Data frame from \code{calculate_monthly_trip_stats()} containing:
\itemize{
\item district: District name
\item date_month: Month as date
\item sample_total_trips: Total trips from tracked boats
\item sample_boats_tracked: Number of tracked boats
\item avg_trip_duration_hrs: Average trip duration
\item avg_trips_per_boat_per_month: Average trips per boat
}}

\item{boat_registry}{Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item district: District name (must match monthly_stats)
\item total_boats: Total number of boats registered in district
}}
}
\value{
A data frame combining monthly statistics with fleet estimates:
\itemize{
\item district: District name
\item date_month: Month as date
\item sample_total_trips: Total trips from tracked boats
\item sample_boats_tracked: Number of tracked boats
\item avg_trip_duration_hrs: Average trip duration
\item avg_trips_per_boat_per_month: Average trips per boat
\item estimated_total_trips: Estimated trips for entire fleet
\item sampling_rate: Proportion of fleet tracked (0-1)
\item estimate_confidence: Confidence level ("High", "Medium", "Low")
}
}
\description{
Estimates total fleet activity by scaling sample-based trip statistics using
boat registry data. Calculates sampling rates and confidence levels for the estimates.
}
\details{
This function combines monthly trip statistics from GPS-tracked boats with
boat registry data to estimate fleet-wide fishing activity. It calculates:
\itemize{
\item Estimated total trips if all boats were tracked
\item Sampling rate (tracked boats / total boats)
\item Confidence levels based on sampling coverage
}

Confidence levels are assigned as:
\itemize{
\item High: â‰¥30\% of fleet tracked
\item Medium: 10-29\% of fleet tracked
\item Low: <10\% of fleet tracked
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First calculate monthly stats
monthly_stats <- calculate_monthly_trip_stats(trips_data)

# Then estimate fleet activity
fleet_estimates <- estimate_fleet_activity(monthly_stats, boat_registry)

# Check confidence levels
fleet_estimates |>
  dplyr::count(estimate_confidence)
