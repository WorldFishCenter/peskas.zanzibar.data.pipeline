\title{Prepare Boat Registry Data from Metadata}
\usage{
prepare_boat_registry(boats_table = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{boats_table}{Data frame containing boat registry information with:
\itemize{
\item District: District name for each boat
\item Additional boat metadata (boat ID, registration details, etc.)
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with boat counts by district:
\itemize{
\item district: District name (standardized from metadata)
\item total_boats: Total number of boats registered in the district
}
}
\description{
Processes boat registry data from metadata table to create a summary
of total boats by district. This data is used for scaling GPS sample data
to fleet-wide estimates.
}
\details{
The function takes boat metadata and creates a district-level summary of boat counts.
This is essential for calculating sampling rates and extrapolating fleet-wide activity
from GPS-tracked samples.

# Get boat registry data from metadata
