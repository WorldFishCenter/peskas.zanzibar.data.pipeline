\title{Standardize Column Names for Matching}
\usage{
standardize_column_names(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with boat identifier columns}
}
\value{
Data frame with standardized column names: registration_number,
boat_name, fisher_name
}
\description{
Renames variant column names to standard names expected by matching functions.
Creates missing columns as NA if they don't exist.
}
\details{
The function handles variant column names from different data sources:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Registration}: vessel_reg_number, boat_reg_no -> registration_number
\item \strong{Fisher}: captain_name, captain -> fisher_name
\item \strong{Boat name}: retained as boat_name
}

If any of these columns are missing entirely, they are created as NA_character_.
