\title{Reshape Species Groups from Wide to Long Format}
\usage{
reshape_species_groups(df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing species group data in wide format}
}
\value{
A data frame in long format with each row representing a single species group record
}
\description{
This function converts a data frame containing repeated species group columns
(species_group.0, species_group.1, etc.) into a long format where each species group
is represented as a separate row, with a column indicating which group it belongs to.
}
\details{
The function identifies columns that follow the pattern "species_group.X" and restructures
the data so that each species group from a submission is represented as a separate row.
It removes the position prefix from column names and adds an n_catch column to track
the group number (1-based indexing). Rows that contain only NA values are filtered out.
