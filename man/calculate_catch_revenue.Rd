\usage{
calculate_catch_revenue(validated, market_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{validated}{A dataframe of validated catch data containing weights and taxonomic information}

\item{market_table}{A dataframe containing market price information by species group and family}
}
\value{
A dataframe with calculated revenues, including:
\itemize{
\item Survey and catch identification
\item Catch details (date, vessel, gear, fishers)
\item Taxonomic information
\item Adjusted catch weights
\item Calculated revenue in TZS

}
\description{
Calculates revenue based on catch weights and market prices. The function handles
missing prices through a hierarchical approach:
\enumerate{
\item Uses direct match if available
\item Falls back to group median price if direct match is missing
\item Uses overall median price if group median is unavailable
}
}
\details{
The function also:
\itemize{
\item Adjusts catch weights based on number of elements when applicable
\item Aggregates catches at the survey and catch number level
\item Calculates total revenue in TZS (Tanzanian Shillings)
