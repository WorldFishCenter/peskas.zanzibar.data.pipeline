\description{
Validates Blue Alliance survey data by performing quality checks and calculating catch metrics.
The function follows these main steps:
\enumerate{
\item Loads and preprocesses survey data
\item Performs logical checks on key variables
\item Calculates catch and length bounds
\item Flags potential data quality issues
\item Saves and uploads validated data
}
}
\details{
The validation includes:
\itemize{
\item Logical checks (non-negative catches, valid fisher counts, valid trip durations)
\item Statistical outlier detection for catch weights and lengths
\item Automated flagging system for quality control
}

Alert flag descriptions:
\itemize{
\item 1: Total catch is negative
\item 2: Number of fishers is 0 or negative
\item 3: Trip duration is 0 or negative
\item 4: Catch weight or length exceeds calculated bounds
}
