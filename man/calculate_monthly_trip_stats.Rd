\title{Calculate Monthly Trip Statistics by District}
\usage{
calculate_monthly_trip_stats(trips_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{trips_data}{A data frame containing trip information with columns:
\itemize{
\item district: District name
\item date_month: Month as date (first day of month)
\item duration_hrs: Trip duration in hours
\item boat: Unique boat identifier
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with monthly statistics by district containing:
\itemize{
\item district: District name
\item date_month: Month as date
\item sample_total_trips: Total trips recorded from tracked boats
\item sample_boats_tracked: Number of unique boats tracked
\item avg_trip_duration_hrs: Average trip duration in hours
\item avg_trips_per_boat_per_month: Average trips per boat (for scaling to fleet)
}
}
\description{
Calculates monthly fishing activity statistics by district based on GPS-tracked boats.
These are estimates from a sample of the total fleet and can be used to extrapolate
fleet-wide fishing activity when combined with boat registry data.
}
\details{
The function processes trip data to generate monthly summaries including:
\itemize{
\item Number of trips recorded from GPS-tracked boats
\item Number of unique boats tracked per month
\item Average trip duration in hours
\item Average trips per boat per month (key metric for fleet scaling)
}

These metrics are particularly useful for estimating total fishing effort when
GPS trackers are only installed on a subset of the fishing fleet.
