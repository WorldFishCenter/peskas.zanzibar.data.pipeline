\title{Reshape Catch Data with Length Groupings}
\usage{
reshape_catch_data(df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing catch data with species groups and length information}
}
\value{
A data frame in long format with each row representing a species at a specific
length range, or just species data if no length information is available
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame with species catch information and reshapes it into a
long format while properly handling nested length group information.
}
\details{
The function first calls \code{reshape_species_groups()} to convert the species data to long format,
then handles the length group information. For length data, it creates separate rows for each
length category while preserving the original structure for catches without length measurements.
Special handling is provided for fish over 100cm, where the actual length is moved to a separate column.

The function preserves all rows, even those without length data, by creating consistent column
structure across all rows.

\dontrun{
final_data <- reshape_catch_data(catch_info)

# Analyze counts by length range
final_data |>
  filter(!is.na(count)) |>
  group_by(species, length_range) |>
  summarize(total_count = sum(as.numeric(count), na.rm = TRUE))
}
