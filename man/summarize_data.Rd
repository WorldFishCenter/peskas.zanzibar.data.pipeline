\title{Summarize WorldFish Survey Data}
\usage{
summarize_data(log_threshold = logger::DEBUG)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_threshold}{The logging level threshold for the logger package (e.g., DEBUG, INFO)
See \code{logger::log_levels} for available options.}
}
\value{
NULL (invisible). The function uploads summary files to cloud storage as a side effect.
}
\description{
Processes validated survey data from WorldFish sources, filtering out flagged submissions
and generating summary datasets for various dimensions:
\itemize{
\item Monthly summaries with aggregated catch metrics
\item Taxa summaries with species-specific information
\item District summaries with submission and effort metrics
\item Gear summaries with gear-specific performance metrics
\item Grid summaries from vessel tracking data
}
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Retrieves validated WF survey data
\item Filters for approved validation status
\item Creates multiple summary datasets:
\itemize{
\item Monthly summaries: Average catch, price, CPUE, and RPUE by district and month
\item Taxa summaries: Catch metrics by species, district, and month
\item District summaries: Submission counts and effort metrics by district
\item Gear summaries: Performance metrics by gear type
\item Grid summaries: Downloaded from cloud storage
}
\item Uploads all summaries to cloud storage as versioned parquet files
}

The metrics calculated include:
\itemize{
\item Total and mean catch weight
\item Price per kg of catch
\item CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort) - both hourly and daily
\item RPUE (Revenue Per Unit Effort) - both hourly and daily
\item Number of submissions and fishers
\item Trip duration
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Summarize WF data with default debug logging
summarize_data()

# Summarize with info-level logging only
summarize_data(logger::INFO)
}
