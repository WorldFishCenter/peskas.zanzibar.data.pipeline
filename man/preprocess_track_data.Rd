\title{Preprocess Track Data into Spatial Grid Summary}
\usage{
preprocess_track_data(data, grid_size = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing GPS track data with columns:
\itemize{
\item Trip: Unique trip identifier
\item Time: Timestamp of the GPS point
\item Lat: Latitude
\item Lng: Longitude
\item Speed (M/S): Speed in meters per second
\item Range (Meters): Range in meters
\item Heading: Heading in degrees
}}

\item{grid_size}{Numeric. Size of grid cells in meters. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item 100: ~100m grid cells
\item 250: ~250m grid cells
\item 500: ~500m grid cells (default)
\item 1000: ~1km grid cells
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item Trip: Trip identifier
\item lat_grid: Latitude of grid cell center
\item lng_grid: Longitude of grid cell center
\item time_spent_mins: Total time spent in grid cell in minutes
\item mean_speed: Average speed in grid cell (M/S)
\item mean_range: Average range in grid cell (Meters)
\item first_seen: First timestamp in grid cell
\item last_seen: Last timestamp in grid cell
\item n_points: Number of GPS points in grid cell
}
}
\description{
This function processes GPS track data into a spatial grid summary, calculating time spent
and other metrics for each grid cell. The grid size can be specified to analyze spatial
patterns at different scales.
}
\details{
The function creates a grid by rounding coordinates based on the specified grid size.
Grid sizes are approximate due to the conversion from meters to degrees, with calculations
based on 1 degree â‰ˆ 111km at the equator. Time spent is calculated using the time
differences between consecutive points.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Process tracks with 500m grid (default)
result_500m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data)

# Use 100m grid for finer resolution
result_100m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 100)

# Use 1km grid for broader patterns
result_1km <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 1000)
}
