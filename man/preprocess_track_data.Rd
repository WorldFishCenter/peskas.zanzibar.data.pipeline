\description{
This function processes GPS track data into a spatial grid summary, calculating time spent
and other metrics for each grid cell. The grid size can be specified to analyze spatial
patterns at different scales.

}
\details{
The function creates a grid by rounding coordinates based on the specified grid size.
Grid sizes are approximate due to the conversion from meters to degrees, with calculations
based on 1 degree ≈ 111km at the equator. Time spent is calculated using the time
differences between consecutive points.
